## Search Algorithms

The task was to implement Dijkstra's search algorithm on a road network. This algorithm was then moedifed for a A* search using a distance heuristic. The heuristic used in this case was Euclidean.

## Occupancy Grid

In this task, range measurements of a LiDAR mounted on a moving vehicle were gathered. The occupany information from these measurments was extracted using an inverse scanner model. Logodd updates was performed using these measurements to iteratively construct a porbablistic occupancy grid.
